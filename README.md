## About

This repository contains the code, the data, and the demo page for the paper *"Monaural Score-Informed Source Separation of Sound Mixtures of Two Guitars"*. | [**Demo Page**](https://chiahohsiung.github.io/Score-Informed-SS-on-Guitars/) | 

This work aims to separate the sounds generated by two guitars. In contrast to separating the sounds of different instruments, this task is much more challenging since the timbre differences are subtle and the pitch range is the same. Therefore, we opt to approach this problem in a **score-informed** setting. In other words, the score of the target guitar is given to the model as side information. We aim to train our model to be insensitive to timbre to deal with the rich diversity of guitar timbre in guitar music. 


## The Model
![Score-Informed Model](/images/model_and_spec.png)
## Implementation
To implement our score-informed version of Open-Unmix [1], please first clone the original [**Open-Unmix repo**](https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch). And replace the files *data.py, model.py, train.py,* and *test.py* to their counterparts in this repo. To train and test the model, please follow these [**docs**](https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch/blob/master/docs).
